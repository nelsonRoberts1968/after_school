# CLUB HUB KIDS

Club Hub Kids was developed by parents with first-hand knowledge and experience in helping children reach their full potential. For every phase of parenthood, from birth through high school we offer compelling resources on a wide variety of family-friendly events, we are very proud of our resource library.

## User Story
​
As a parent
I want to be able to find classes and camps appropriate for my child
When I filter by category, I am shown classes only in that category
When I filter by location, I am shown classes only in that location
When I signup, I will have access to an account where I can store registrations and share events with other local parents/caregivers/service providers.
